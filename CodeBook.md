====================

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The experiments have been carried out to measure six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) acceleration and velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz is captured. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

__Following principles of Tidy Data set were used to transform the variables__

- Lower Case Variables - camelCase was used for the variablesas lower case would make them unreadable. 
- Descriptive Variables - the variable names are descriptive, so nothing special should be done.
- No Duplicates & Special Characters were allowed.
